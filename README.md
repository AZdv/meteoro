Meteoro - Pomodoro App on Meteor
--------------------------------

The idea is simple, this app follows the original Pomodoro principles:

 - Choose a task
 - Start a Pomodoro (25 Minutes)
 - Take a Short Break (5 Minutes)
 - Start another Pomodoro
 - After 4 Pomodoros, take a Long Break (25 Minutes)

The application is very clean, while still pleasant looking (I hope).
The tab title is updated when the timer is running - no need to check the tab to know how much time is left.

A picture is worth a thousand words:
